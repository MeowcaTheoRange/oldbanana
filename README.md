OldBanana is a browser extension that reintroduces Gamebanana features and reverts detrimental changes on the client side. It will locally keep track of your UI themes, will allow you to fully rearrange your navbar, will come with remakes of old modules and some new ones, and eventually will include other enhancements as well.  
  
OldBanana will also include several new, unique features that the site has never offered. These can range from new tools to simple quality-of-life improvements.  

The extension is designed specifically for the latest version of Firefox. It will also work with forks of Firefox, like the TOR Browser. A version for Google Chrome, Opera, Brave and Microsoft Edge is planned for the future.
